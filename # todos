# todos:


[[ done ]]
- remove max / min values in new game creation

[[ done ? ]]
- **get_user_games**
    - This returns all of a User's active games. <todo what if the player prevented concurrent games? Maybe this should be a list of all games (active or not) that the user is related to>
    - You may want to modify the `User` and `Game` models to simplify this type
    of query. **Hint:** it might make sense for each game to be a `descendant`
    of a `User`.

[[ done ]]
 - **cancel_game**
    - This endpoint allows users to cancel a game in progress.
    You could implement this by deleting the Game model itself, or add a Boolean field such as 'cancelled' to the model. Ensure that Users are not permitted to remove *completed* games.

    - deletes the game model.

[[ done ]]
 - **get_high_scores**
    - Remember how you defined a score in Task 2?
    Now we will use that to generate a list of high scores in descending order, a leader-board!
    - Accept an optional parameter `number_of_results` that limits the number of results returned.
    - Note: If you choose to implement a 2-player game this endpoint is not required.

    - returns list of top N high scores


[[ fewest average guesses? ]]
 - **get_user_rankings**
    - Come up with a method for ranking the performance of each player.
      For "Guess a Number" this could be by winning percentage with ties broken by the average number of guesses.
    - Create an endpoint that returns this player ranking. The results should include each Player's name and the 'performance' indicator (eg. win/loss ratio).


[[ in progress ]]
 - **get_game_history**
    - Your API Users may want to be able to see a 'history' of moves for each game.
    - For example, Chess uses a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" target="_blank">PGN</a>) which allows any game to be replayed and watched move by move.
    - Add the capability for a Game's history to be presented in a similar way. For example: If a User made played 'Guess a Number' with the moves:
    (5, 8, 7), and received messages such as: ('Too low!', 'Too high!',
    'You win!'), an endpoint exposing the game_history might produce something like:
    [('Guess': 5, result: 'Too low'), ('Guess': 8, result: 'Too high'),
    ('Guess': 7, result: 'Win. Game over')].
    - Adding this functionality will require some additional properties in the 'Game' model along with a Form, and endpoint to present the data to the User.


### Task 4: Improve Notifications
In the skeleton Guess a Number project, a cron job and associated handler have been created (see cron.yaml and main.py).
This sends an hourly reminder email to every User with an email address to try out 'Guess a Number'.
This is probably annoying the users.

Modify the SendReminderEmail handler so that this reminder email is only sent to users that have incomplete games (or some other logic that makes sense to you).
Make sure to update the message to reflect this.

**Optional Improvements:**
- If you're feeling  ambitious you can implement more sophisticated notifications.
For example: "If the User has not made a move in an active game for more than 12 hours, send a reminder email that includes the current game state."
- If you created a two-player game, you can implement a turn notification system!
When one user makes a move, add a task to the task queue to notify the User's opponent that it's their turn.
You can use the `SendReminderEmail` handler in main.py as a template.
Remember that you will need to pass parameters to identify the Game and User that should receive the reminder.
Don't forget to update `app.yaml` with the new Handler listing.
Finally, consult Google App Engine documentation for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/overview-push" target="_blank">Using Push Queues in Python</a>.

#### Task 5: README and API Documentation
Be sure to document your game. Your README file should include:

1. Instructions for playing the game
2. Detailed descriptions of each endpoint

Remember, you are documenting an API that another programmer may want to use as the basis for a web or mobile app.
An api user should *not* need to read the source code to understand how to use it.
You may follow the format of 'Guess a Number' for your README.

### Reflect on Your Design
Document your design decisions by answering the following questions:

- What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
- What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

These answers should be in a file Design.txt.
Your responses can be in paragraph form or bulleted lists.
This document should be around 500 words long.
